        <p>Fishing is allowed in Stansbury Lake for residents of Stansbury Park and their guests.</p>
        
        <p>Because Stansbury Lake is a private lake, No Fishing License is Required when fishing.</p>
        
        <p>The Millpond is not a private body of water and is open to residents and non-residents for fishing.</p>
        
        <p>Because the Millpond is a public waterway, it is regulated by the Division of Wildlife Resources, therefore, a fishing license is required when fishing on the Millpond.</p>
